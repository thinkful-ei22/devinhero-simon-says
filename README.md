# Simon Says

## An old-time classic for your phone
Test your memory! This takes the classic Simon board and puts it in your pocket, with a small twist. Four colored buttons will flash in a sequence, which you must repeat back by pushing the corresponding buttons in the same order. Every time you succeed, another item is added to the sequence and Simon repeats himself. But be careful! Not every flashing light is said by Simon. Pay attention to the light in the middle to know which commands to ignore!
